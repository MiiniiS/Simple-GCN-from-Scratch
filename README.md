# ðŸ§  Simple GCN from Scratch (Graph Convolutional Network)

This project demonstrates a **basic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** implementation built entirely from **NumPy**, along with **NetworkX** for graph representation and **Matplotlib** for visualization.  

It serves as an educational example to understand how GCN layers perform **feature propagation and aggregation** in graph-structured data â€” **without using deep learning libraries** like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

### ðŸ”¹ Key Components
- **Adjacency Matrix (`A`)** â€” Defines node connections  
- **Feature Matrix (`X`)** â€” Node feature inputs  
- **Graph Normalization** â€” Symmetric normalization of the adjacency matrix  
- **GCN Layer** â€” Aggregates neighbor features and applies ReLU activation  
- **Graph Visualization** â€” Draws the graph structure using NetworkX
